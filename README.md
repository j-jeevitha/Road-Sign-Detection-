# 🚦 Road Sign Detection Using YOLOv8

A real-time road sign detection system using YOLOv8 and Roboflow dataset. This project helps identify road signs and enhances safety by providing alerts for missed signs.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- Roboflow
- Torch, torchvision

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset was obtained and preprocessed from **Roboflow**, containing over 100 road sign categories.

Folder structure:
```
📁 train/
📁 valid/
📁 test/
```

## 📌 Model Training

Model used: `yolov8n.pt` (Nano model from Ultralytics)

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")  # Or use yolov8s.pt or yolov8m.pt
model.train(data="custom_data.yaml", epochs=50)
```

## 🔍 Installation

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio opencv-python ultralytics
```
